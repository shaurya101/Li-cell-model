# Li-cell-model
A basic detail report is published (link in about)

This project is about modelling and predicting Li ion NMC cell behaviour with respect to NEDC current profile. SOC, OCV, Temperature, resistance, capacitance, Power loss are some parameters that were simulated.


Modelled graphs are available to view in results folder.

Also a pdf of "All model diagrams" in available to view.
